Visual Observation Demo 
====================================
This demo showcases the abilities of the IBM Watson Visual Recognition Service.
More specifically the demo makes it possible to connect a smartphone functioning as
a webcam taking pictures every few seconds and sends them to a Node-RED application. 
The Node-RED application sends the pictures to the IBM Watson Visual Recognition Service and 
displays the results of the service in a dashboard.
